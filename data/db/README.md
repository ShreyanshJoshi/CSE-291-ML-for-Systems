## Features

- Convert SQLite database files to MySQL SQL dump files
- Option to export table structures only, data only, or both
- Customize MySQL table options such as engine, character set, and collation
- Automatically handle Ctrl+C interruptions for graceful termination

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLite and MySQL databases

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/majidalavizadeh/sqlite-to-mysql.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd sqlite-to-mysql
```

3. Run the converter script:

```
python export.py <sqlite_db_file> [mysql_dump_file] [options]
```

- `<sqlite_db_file>`: Path to the SQLite database file.
- `[mysql_dump_file]` (Optional): Path to the output MySQL SQL dump file.
  If not provided, the SQLite database with .sql extension will be used as the default.

Options:

- `--engine=ENGINE`: (Optional) MySQL engine for table. Default: InnoDB.
- `--charset=CHARSET`: (Optional) MySQL character set for table. Default: utf8mb4.
- `--collate=COLLATE`: (Optional) MySQL collation for table. Default: utf8mb4_unicode_ci.
- `--no-drop`: (Optional) Do not include the "DROP TABLE IF EXISTS" syntax in SQL dump.

## Examples

- Convert SQLite to MySQL with default options:

```
python export.py input.db
```

- Convert SQLite to MySQL with custom MySQL options:

```
python export.py input.db output.sql --engine=MyISAM --charset=utf8 --collate=utf8_general_ci
```
